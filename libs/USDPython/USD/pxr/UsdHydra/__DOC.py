Overview
========

This module is now deprecated and will be deleted soon. UsdHydra used
to provide schemas and behaviors for creating and connecting shading
networks based on UsdShade.

The schemas in this module have been deleted. Currently, it provides
only the list of tokens used in the schemas, to assist in the gradual
transition to the new-style of hydra shaders authored using the shader
registry.
